2.  **Clean Code**: Follow SOLID principles. Keep functions small and focused.
3.  **Modern Standards**: Use the latest stable features of the language/framework detected.
4.  **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling, don't just ignore errors.
5.  **Types**: If using a typed language (TS, Go, Rust), be strict with types. Avoid `any`.
